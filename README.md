## 📝 Note on Database
This project currently demonstrates CRUD functionality using Node.js and Express.js without a persistent database.  
Data handling is done at the application level.  
Due to time constraints, database integration (MySQL/MongoDB) has not been implemented in this version and is planned as a future enhancement.
